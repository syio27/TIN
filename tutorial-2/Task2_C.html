    <h2 class="header">Google Search</h2>
    <p class="article">Google Search (known simply as Google), is a search engine provided by Google. Handling over 3.5 billion searches per day, it has a 92% share of the global search engine market. It is also the most-visited website in the world.

    The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called "PageRank". Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more.

    The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1997 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Larry Page</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin">Sergey Brin</a>, and Scott Hassan. In June 2011, Google introduced "Google Voice Search" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words. In May 2012, Google introduced a Knowledge Graph semantic search feature in the U.S.

    Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends.Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Google's search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks.</p>

    <h2 class="header">Google Images</h2>

    <p class="article">Google Images (previously Google Image Search) is a search engine owned by Google that allows users to search the World Wide Web for images. It was introduced on July 12, 2001 due to a demand for pictures of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Versace_dress_of_Jennifer_Lopez">Green Versace dress of Jennifer Lopez </a> worn in February 2000.In 2011, reverse image search functionality was added.

    When searching for an image, a thumbnail of each matching image is displayed. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the image is displayed in a larger size, and users may visit the webpage on which the image is used.</p>

    <h2 class="header">Google Ads</h2>
    <p class="article">Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) is an online advertising platform developed by Google, where advertisers bid to display brief advertisements, service offerings, product listings, or videos to web users. It can place ads both in the results of search engines like Google Search (the Google Search Network) and on non-search websites, mobile apps, and videos (the Google Display Network). Services are offered under a pay-per-click (PPC) pricing model.

    Google Ads is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.">Alphabet Inc's</a> main source of revenue, contributing US$134.8 billion in 2019.<br></p>
